This C file uses user input (characters or integers depending on what the prompt says) to ask the user what conversion from the list they want to do.
After selecting what type of conversion you want (distance, weight, etc.) it will ask which direction you want to convert (metric to imperial or imperial to metric).
Then the user inputs the value (as a double) of what is to be converted as indicated by the prompt. 
Finally, once the user is given the conversion, they are asked whether they want to do another conversion.
